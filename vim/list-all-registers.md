# List All Registers

Instead of constantly re-yanking or re-deleting the thing you want to paste,
list all the current registers with `:reg`.

To use any of these registers, use the `"` with the number of the register.

*For example:*
`"0P` will paste the contents of the 0 register (the next to most recent item)
in front of the cursor.
