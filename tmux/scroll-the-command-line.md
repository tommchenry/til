# Scroll The Command Line

Scrolling the terminal output in Tmux is a little confusing. You're looking for your prefix key (mine's `C-a`) then `[`. It's similar to `C-a {` which flips the active panes.

Once you've switched to scroll mode, arrow keys and Vim movement keys will move you around. Press `q` to return to the prompt.
